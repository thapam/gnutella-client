README FILE FOR GROUP20'S ASSIGNMENT-1

HOW TO BUILD AND RUN?
To build the application use GNU C compiler on Linux. Follow the steps mentioned below

1) Change to assignment_1 directory.
2) To build use the following command. The executable will be created in current directory
	gcc ./src/node.c -o node
3) Run the executable "node" by specifying a port as an argument
	./node 6346


USING THE APPLICATION
After successful build and run, a menu will be provided listing the supported commands which are as follows.
 - connect <ip> <port>
 - peers
 - query <key>
 - pingb <ip> <port>
 - bye


USAGE GUIDELINES
1) Connect to at least one node (bootstrap node) after starting the application. To connect use the "connect" command and specify ip and port.
	connect 130.233.195.30 6346
	connect 130.233.195.31 6346
	connect 130.233.195.32 6346
2) To view the peers connected to the node, use the "peers" command
	peers
3) To query the network for key value pairs, use the "query" command and specify the query key. Query hits will be displayed.
	query commonkey
4) To find neighbors of a connected node use the "pingb" command specifying ip and port. The application will return the list of neighbors of the node.
Check the peers command to get list of connected peers.
	pingb 130.233.195.30 6346
5) To disconnect from all peers and exit the application use the "bye" command.
	bye


LOGGING OF MESSAGES
All the messages received and sent by the application are logged in the "log.txt" file. 
This includes:
 - PING A requests sent/received every 5 seconds and correspong PONG A responses
 - PING B requests send by pingb command and corresponding PONG B responses
 - QUERY requests, QHIT responses
 - JOIN requests and responses
 
 Incoming messages are marked as "<--" while outgoing messages are logged as "-->". View the cat command to view the log file.
 	cat log.txt
 
 
 For querying this node from other nodes, we have published three key-value pairs
 	1) "commonkey":0x110A5150
 	2) "group20key":0x20
 	3) "lostkey":0x666
